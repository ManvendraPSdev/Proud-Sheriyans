# All the div , p , h are called the block elements , but all the a(anchor tag) are the inline elements 

* we cannot give the height , weight to the inline element

* If we want to convert the block element into the inline element or  inline element into the block element then we have to use the property **display : inline-block** , so basically now the element is having both the properties inline and block properties
